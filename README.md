# Hangmang Game 
### Universitary project

This is a Hangman game I made using C in VS Code.
In order to play the game and joy the experience, you must put (or have) "conio.c" in your "include" repertory (for example: C:\MinGW\include).
This game was made by instructions  of my teacher, so it may not be exactly like a common hangman game.
